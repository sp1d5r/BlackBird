Private Messaging Platform - Delayed Notifications

## The Pitch
You're a busy person right? You've probably found yourself getting into a deep work session. Which is great! Now you've also probably experienced this before:
* Your focus is ruined from notifications on your phone,
* You ignore notifications on your phone because you're working and you forget to reply to the person.
This is awful. You hate it. You wish you had a way to delay the push notifications for a certain amount of time, or delay them until you're ready. 
This way you get them when you're free and you don't have to worry about anything. 

Okay. I want that too. 

## History 
I built an app like this before, but just for my friends when I was 16, it was pretty fun, but it didn't allow for notifications. So now I am presenting BlackBird 2.0 
the new and improved way to message. I'll give it a cool theme as well and maybe throw in some machine learning somewhere. 

## Social Media 
these are my social media's, stay tuned because I will publish the source code to the predecesor of the mechanics calculator, the statistics calculator, this app managed to gain over 3000+ app installs.
